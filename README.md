# Rattle Snake

Python library for generating interesting 
(at least according to my arbitrary criteria) points


![Plane Map of Weird Science](images/weird_science_plane.png)

A future state of this project will be used to populate 
the backed for the [beings project](https://github.com/joedaws/beings)

## Setup

### pyenv
https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/

### Poetry
https://python-poetry.org/

## installing dependencies

``` shell
poetry install
```

## How to run
For now try

``` shell
poetry run python -m rattle_snake.plane_map --test
```

which will generate an image in the images directory for a certain
plane of existence.

## How are plane maps generated?

There are multiple planes of existence, one for each of the 3
cultures of beings from the [beings](https://github.com/joedaws/beings) simulation.
Each plane is made up of concentric circles corresponding to the different ranks
that beings might have. For each circle, there are two kinds of categories of nodes,
population centers and supporting nodes. 

**Node**
The locations of the population centers are generated by
randomly generating the polar coordinates of a point. The
angle is obtained by sampling a uniform random variable on 
the interval `[0, 2_&pi;_]` and the radius is obtained by
taking a uniformly random sample from the interval 
`[lower_bound, upper_bound]`. The bounds are determined according 
to the particular stratum of the population center, where the `0th`
stratum is the center most concentric circle. 
When sampling to obtain a radius for a node, we take into account
a `boundary_delta` which keeps generated nodes away from the
boundary, this if for aesthetic reasons.

**Edges**
The population centers are connected to all of the their 
supporting nodes, and some of the supporting nodes are connected to 
the supporting nodes of other population centers. 
Edges between clusters are drawn by finding the closest two
supporting nodes from different clusters and connecting them.


## How will this project communicate with the Beings simulation?

One pattern is to use files like csv or json.

Another is to consider using database, (start with SQLite why not).

Third option, translate this project to Elixir

# Streams

## October 26, 2022

- Whenever a new call to `generate_map` is called
  we'll put those nodes in a new database. Created
  a function to make a new database file and added the
  `create_new_nodes` argument of the constructor of
  `PlaneMap`.
- When instantiating a `PlaneMap` added the ability to load 
  from a database or create a database. When a database file 
  is passed to the constructor, the nodes are loaded from that
  database. On the other hand when there is no file passed 
  to the constructor, we create the nodes and a database
  where those nodes are stored.
  
## November 2, 2022

- Build edges between population centers and supporting nodes
- Store edges in the edges table of the database
- Load edges from database when starting up from database

## November 9, 2022

- Draw an edge between clusters by drawing an edge between the 
  closest supporting nodes of each cluster
  
## November 16, 2022 

- Increase the number of connections so that all clusters 
  are connected in the sense that there is a path from each
  node to any other node.
  
## November 23, 2022

off due to holiday

## November 30, 2022

- Add minimum distance between population centers
- allow different number of population centers for central
  versus all other strata
- refactor *generate_nodes* so that it only generates nodes
  and doesn't have to also draw
- first attempt at using streamlit for visualization


## December 6, 2022
- Use streamlit for interaction
- Add visualization of all three planes
  - 3d plot with parallel planes
- experiment with transparent background and plotting over an
  interest background image
  
## Notes for improvement

### Use efficient node distance algorithm

We need to compute the pair distance between many nodes
when deciding how the clusters will be connected. The
current implementation uses a k-nearest neighbors algorithm
`trained` on each cluster's nodes. There are more efficient
algorithms for computing distances than what we used first.
Therefore, we could speed up the node joining process by
improving the efficiency of the distance finding algorithm.
  
### Database improvements

Could use a different database to support the back-end of this project.
In the future we'll connect this setup to a nodes table which will be
the backend of the [beings](https://github.com/joedaws/beings)

A interesting solution to explore next will be the 
[cockroachdb](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/pricing/)
